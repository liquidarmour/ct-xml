    <p>Complete part 2 to obtain relief for loans included in box A2 that were repaid, released or written off if</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the return is for the period in which the loans were made and</li>
        <li>the loan was repaid, released or written off after the end of the period but earlier than nine months and one day after the end of the accounting period in which the loan was made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Enter in the table details for each participator or associate. If there have been a number of repayments on an account, enter
        only the total repayments for that account and give the date of the last repayment. A separate entry must be made for each
        loan or part loan that has been released or written off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example
        <br />
        A company makes a loan during the accounting period ended 31 December 2004 and it is all repaid to the company on
        30 June 2005. The company's tax return for the accounting period ended 31 December 2004 is sent to HM Revenue &amp;
        Customs on 1 November 2005. Part 2 should be completed because the loan was repaid after the end of the accounting
        period but earlier than nine months and one day after it.
