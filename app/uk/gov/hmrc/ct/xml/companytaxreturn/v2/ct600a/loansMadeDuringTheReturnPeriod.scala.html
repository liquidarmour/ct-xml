        You must complete part 1 if the company is close and has made a loan to an individual participator, or associate of a participator, during the return period which has not been repaid within the return period.
        <br />
        Enter in the table below, details of any outstanding loans made to a participator or associate of a participator during the return period. If the participator or associate has a current or loan account with the company, enter details of each participator's or associate's account. The amount you enter in column 2 of the table is the total of all debit entries on the account, less any credit entries and less any credit balance brought forward from the previous return period. In arriving at this figure you must exclude any credit entries that represent repayment, release or write off of loans made in earlier return periods.
