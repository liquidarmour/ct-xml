    <h2><i>Investments and loans within Sch 20 ICTA 1988 box E26 charities only</i></h2>
    <p>Qualifying investments and loans, for the purposes of S506 ICTA 1988, are specified in Parts I and II of Sch 20 ICTA 1988</p>
    <p>Charities can make claims to HM Revenue &amp; Customs for any loan or other investment not specified in Sch 20 but made for the benefit of the charity and not for avoidance of tax, to be accepted as qualifying. </p>
    <p>Put an 'X' in box E26 only if all investments and loans are qualifying investments and loans:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>automatically, because they are specified in Sch 20, or</li>
        <li>because the charity has either claimed (with this return or separately) that they are under Paragraphs 9 or 10 of Sch 20 ICTA 1988, or is prepared to do so on request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a claim for qualifying status to succeed, the loan or investment must be made for the benefit of the charity and not for the avoidance of tax (whether by the charity or any other person). Claims should be in writing and specify</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the nature of the item (loans, or shares for example)</li>
        <li>the amount</li>
        <li>the period</li>
        <li>whether the claim is under Paragraph 9 or 10.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is helpful if a claim includes full details, for example the terms of a loan.</p>

    <h2><i>Investments and loans made outside Sch 20 ICTA 1988 box E27 charities only</i></h2>
    <p>If the charity has made any investments or loans which do not fall within Schedule 20 ICTA 1988, and no claim is being made with this return, enter the total of such loans or investments in box E27.</p>

    <h2><i>Restrictions of relief for non-qualifying expenditure</i></h2>
    <p>Relief under S505(1) ICTA 1988 and S256 TCGA 1992 may not be available to some charities</p>
    <p>The charity should attach a calculation of restriction of relief under S505(3) ICTA 1988 and send it with this return. If you need help with this calculation please telephone our helpline on 08453 020203 or email charities@@hmrc.gov.uk</p>
    <p>Where a CASC has incurred non-qualifying expenditure its exemptions from tax may need to be restricted. The CASC should include a calculation of the restriction of relief under Schedule 18, Paragraph 8 FA 2002 with this return. If you need help with this calculation please telephone our helpline on 08453 020203 or email charities@@hmrc.gov.uk</p>
